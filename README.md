I Approach developing programs by planning and breaking down tasks. Divide your project into smaller, manageable goals. Choose appropriate tools and languages: Write clean and readable code: Focus on code clarity and maintainability. Test and debug thoroughly: Identify and fix errors early and often. 
 
 
New Development Strategies I used were object-oriented programming. Choosing appropriate data structures and algorithms based on your project's needs. Learn advanced debugging tools and techniques for efficient error identification and resolution. Apply optimization strategies to improve code performance and efficiency. Continuously improve your code based on feedback and testing.Don't hesitate to revisit and improve existing code when needed. Be prepared to adjust your development plan based on new information or feedback. 
Through milestone my coding technique evolved by Learning from experience. Reflect on successes and failures from previous milestones to improve future practices. Embracing new technologies and staying up to date with new tools and technologies in the field. Developing problem-solving skills: Practice solving complex problems through coding and analysis. 
 
 
Computer science can help me reach my goals due to it teaching you how to break down complex problems into manageable steps. Logical thinking and analysis: You learn to reason logically and analyze data effectively. Gain expertise in using various programming languages and tools. Develop valuable skills to solve new challenges and innovate in diverse fields. Gain a deeper understanding of 3D modeling, animation, rendering, and visualization techniques.
